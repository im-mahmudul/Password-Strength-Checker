# Password-Strength-Checker
Description: Develop a tool that evaluates the strength of passwords based on various criteria (length, complexity, and dictionary word usage).
Skills: Programming, understanding password policies, basic regex.
Tools: C.


Here’s a basic outline and code for creating a Password Strength Checker in C. This project will check if a password meets certain criteria to determine its strength level (weak, moderate, or strong). We’ll assess the strength based on:

	1.	Length: Password must be at least 8 characters long.
	2.	Character Variety: It should include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
	3.	Feedback: It will provide feedback based on whether the password meets all criteria.

 Steps

	1.	Prompt the user to enter a password.
	2.	Check the password length.
	3.	Check for lowercase, uppercase, digits, and special characters.
	4.	Provide feedback on the password strength.
